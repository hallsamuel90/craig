TUI polish: full-width context-aware footer and panel navigation fixes

The command bar is now a full-width footer spanning all three panels, showing keybinding hints that update based on which panel and mode is active. The review panel's "sync PR" and "close task" actions moved into the footer. Arrow keys no longer cross panel boundaries (use Tab/Shift-Tab), and Tab from the inspector panel no longer drops into an invisible focus region.
