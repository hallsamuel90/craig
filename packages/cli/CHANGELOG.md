# craig-cli

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 3620dfb: Fix alternate-runner agent tabs so creating and attaching a second runner tab opens the live PTY instead of showing the attach prompt.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- f59cffe: TUI polish: full-width context-aware footer and panel navigation fixes

  The command bar is now a full-width footer spanning all three panels, showing keybinding hints that update based on which panel and mode is active. The review panel's "sync PR" and "close task" actions moved into the footer. Arrow keys no longer cross panel boundaries (use Tab/Shift-Tab), and Tab from the inspector panel no longer drops into an invisible focus region.

## 0.2.1

- 0554da4: Add proprietary license metadata and update the README around TUI-first usage.

## 0.2.0
